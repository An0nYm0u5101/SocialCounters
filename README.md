##Instructions
* The Twitter and Vine counters require PHP to work, all other counters only require jQuery. 
* After uploading all files to the server, you might need to change this in the api.js for  Twitter and Vine. Change ../SocialCounter/twitter/index.php to http://yoursite.com/SocialCounter/twitter/index.php to include the path to your domain.
* Most of these counters require either access tokens, client id or keys. You need to create these keys in order to display a value.
* In the index.html, place your username and tokens inside the single quotes and it should work.
